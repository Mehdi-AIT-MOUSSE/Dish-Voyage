    <h2>The Origins of Pad Thai:</h2>
    <p>
        Pad Thai's roots can be traced back to the 20th century when Thailand was actively promoting a sense of national identity and unity.

        In an effort to create a distinct Thai dish, vendors began to prepare stir-fried noodles using local ingredients and flavors. This marked the birth of Pad Thai, a dish that perfectly blends sweet, sour, salty, and spicy flavors to create a harmonious culinary experience.
