    <h2>The Origins of Poutine:</h2>

    <p>
        The exact origins of poutine are a subject of debate, but it is widely believed to have originated in rural Quebec in the late 1950s. One popular origin story attributes the creation of poutine to a restaurateur named Le Roy Jucep in Drummondville, Quebec. The story goes that a customer requested a mix of cheese curds and fries, prompting Jucep to respond with, "ça va faire une maudite poutine" (that will make a damn mess), thus coining the dish's name.
